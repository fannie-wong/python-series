we can define function inside function:

example1:
def fun1(x):
    def fun2(y):
        return x*y
    return fun2
print(fun1(4)(8))
#fun1(4) returns x*y with x=4
#by setting y=8, we can get the result x*y=32

example2: 
#define y=8 in fun1, then by setting the parameter in fun2(y), the value can pass to fun2
#be caution that while defining fun2(), the format should be coordinated with the return function.
def fun1(x):
    y=8
    def fun2(y):
        return x*y
    return fun2(y)
print(fun1(4))

example3:
#the usage of nonlocal to pass the value of x in fun3 to fun4
def fun3():
    x=5
    def fun4():
        nonlocal x
        x*=x
        return x
    return fun4()
print(fun3())
